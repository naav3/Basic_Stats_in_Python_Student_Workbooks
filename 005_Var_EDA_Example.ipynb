    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis is that over time, prices in Edmonton will rise. If we can invest in a segment of the market that is undervalued, that segment will rise faster as it \"catches up\" with the rest. We don't know if this hypothesis is true in reality - in the future we could do some predictive modelling to try to test it. We are going with a HIPPO opinion - low valued segments will rise, so that is what we will look for in our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also are smaller investors. We don't have the up front cash to purchase big money properties and \"swing for the fences\", we would very much prefer to target properties that are relatively less expensive, to allow us to purchase more and diversify the risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, our goal is to identify which segments of real estate have values that are suitable for investment, based on our assumptions.  \n",

    "Use: Attempt to break down and examine the data to find some property groups that appear to be solid investments, supported by the data you have. You can follow my example, or go your own way. There's probably many potential groups that make sense. The solution version has everything I did. Feel free to add more code blocks. I chopped them down so there are not a tonne of empty ones. As well, the exploration is somewhat open ended. If you want to closely follow along my steps, that's fine. You could do things differently, or in a somewhat different order, and that would be all good too. If you feel very comfortable doing things on your own, it is \"better\" practice to follow less closely. </b>"
